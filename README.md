# Data Visualization with Python

Welcome to the **Data Visualization with Python** repository! This repository contains scripts, examples, and resources to help you create stunning and informative visualizations using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.

## About the Libraries

### **Matplotlib**
Matplotlib is a foundational library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It provides fine-grained control over plots and supports various types of charts like line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.

### **Seaborn**
Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and simplifies the creation of visually appealing statistical plots. It is ideal for visualizing complex datasets and includes built-in themes, color palettes, and support for statistical aggregation.

### **Plotly**
Plotly is a versatile library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations. It supports a wide range of chart types, including 3D plots, maps, and dashboards, making it suitable for dynamic and exploratory data analysis.
